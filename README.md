## Description

Sidcup Family Golf is a multipurpose golf facility located in Sidcup, South East London. The website showcases various features and services offered by Sidcup Family Golf, including Toptracer Range, Golf Lessons, Adventure Golf, Coffee Shop, and Leagues. The website is designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly, making it easy for visitors to explore and learn more about the facility.

The repository contains the HTML and CSS code that allows you to create a similar website like https://sidcupfamilygolf.com . The HTML file (`index.html`) provides the structure and content of the web pages, while the CSS file (`style.css`) defines the visual styling and layout.

Feel free to customize the HTML and CSS files according to your needs. You can modify the content, colors, styles, and layout to match your branding or design preferences. The CSS file utilizes the Montserrat font from Google Fonts, but you can replace it with any other font if desired.
